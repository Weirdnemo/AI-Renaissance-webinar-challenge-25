# Data Science & Machine Learning Webinar Challenge

## Challenge Overview
Congratulations on completing the webinar on Data Science and Machine Learning! To put your learning into action, we have designed a challenge for you. This is an opportunity to apply the concepts you've learned, especially Logistic Regression, and demonstrate your problem-solving skills.

### Objective
The goal is to create a predictive model using Logistic Regression that can classify whether a passenger survived or not based on the given Titanic dataset.

## The Dataset

The dataset provided is named `titanic.csv`. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic. Your task is to analyze the dataset and build a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived (`Survived` = 1) or not (`Survived` = 0).

### Dataset Details
- **Filename:** `titanic.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
  - `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
  - `Name`: Name of the passenger.
  - `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
  - `Age`: Age of the passenger.
  - `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
  - `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
  - `Ticket`: Ticket number.
  - `Fare`: Passenger fare.
  - `Survived`: Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).

## Tasks
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Analyze the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical data.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Implement Logistic Regression to classify the `Survived` variable.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate your model.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the results.

4. **Bonus Task:**
   - Optimize your Logistic Regression model by experimenting with hyperparameters or feature engineering.
   - Visualize key insights, such as the relationship between `Fare` and `Survived`.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Submit a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) containing:
   - Data exploration steps.
   - Logistic Regression model implementation.
   - Evaluation results and visualizations.

2. Provide a brief report summarizing your findings and the model's performance.

3. Email your submission to [airenaissance.dtc@gmail.com](mailto:airenaissance.dtc@gmail.com) by **[14-JAN-2025]**.

## Resources
- Refer to the slides and examples covered during the webinar.
- Use online documentation for additional guidance (e.g., [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)).

## Challenge Rules
- You must work individually on this challenge.
- Feel free to use any programming environment (Python recommended).
- Late submissions will not be accepted.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!
